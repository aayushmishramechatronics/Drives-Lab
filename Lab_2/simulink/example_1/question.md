### Question:

Using the Differential Equation:

\[
V = R*i + L di/dt
\]

1. Derive the Expression for:

\[
\ di/dt
\]

2. Design a **Simulink Block Diagram** to Model the `RL Circuit Current` \( i(t) \).

3. Clearly Indicate:
   - How the **Integrator block** will be Used.
   - How the **Feedback Loop** involving \( R \cdot i \) is Implemented in your Model.
